Joystick: Kempston (Sinclair/Cursor/Disabled/etc)



=================================================================
Notes - z88dk building with different Nirvana rows - keep:
----------------------------------------------------------
Config Nirvana row count (eg. 7 or 23) in z88dk before build:

c:/z88dk/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/target/zx/config/config_nirvanap.m4

Then, run from commandline: (in path C:\z88dk\libsrc\_DEVELOPMENT>)

Winmake.bat ZX

(zx is paramater for winmake)

Then build from my build.bat (also of course using the correct compiled Nirvana engine to match the row count)
=================================================================








Detect 'search result not found':  *** Use row count bits - set row count bits to zero before trying to load search result screen.  If after load, row cunt bits == 0, load must have failed ***

set one of the invisible bytes on the top bar to be 0 before attempting to load search result (on all generated .scr files, that byte should then always be set to 255).  If the byte  is still 0 after trying to load, we know the load failed (eg. search result not found).  Then do alternative logic flow.  If space if tight, this could be a single bit, rather than a whole byte, which is a little wasteful (wrt future use of the top bar for other stuff not yet though of).



Get installer to make the numbered .TAP files in a folder to copy to SD

Implement cursor key/joystick controls instead of qaop





Get NIVRNANAP_stop/start working for fast screen redraw 

Design/implement some kind of Options menu (from symbol shift key?)in the launcher (Credits, kempston controls, other misc config options)

Design implement first part of Search system, second part pending Daniel A Nagy work on OPEN command


Compile to .sna as well/instead of .tap

Organise memory management

Smoothly scroll truncated names into view

Swicthable to 64 column mode frm display prefs.
FZX proportional font. z88dk already includes extensive support for FZX.

Screensaver to stop phosphor burn

Beeper sound fx for typing search chars etc

128k sound/music options?

Custom font(s) - original ZX ROM font, wide ZX ROM font, C64, Amstrad CPC, DOS PC (fonts available here: https://damieng.com/blog/2011/02/20/typography-in-8-bits-system-fonts 

Color schemes (C64, Amstrad green screen, vanilla ZX white paper, custom rainbow bar etc)

Streaming data from database - pending Daniel A Nagy work on the OPEN dot command (seek functionality)

Desktop Installer:  
- options to include .sna,.z80,.tap, others formats?
- option to set as autoboot
- option to only take first matching file from each subfolder (to fix where I have multiple .taps of same game in game folder)
- test mac and Linux versions

Alpha/beta testing:  Günter Brütting, Cristián González from DivMMC fb group volunteered for testing

Open source project: When codebase stable make one (or two, one for Installer, one for Launcher?) or two github repos.
