My Installation Instructions
----------------------------

1. Extract the z88dk folder to C:\

2. Environment Variables

	PATH
	Very little to say, just note that as for almost every programming kit z88dk requires the PATH environment variable to include the <application root>\z88dk\bin directory.

	ZCCCFG
	It is used by ZCC to find the target dependent configuration files. It should be set to point to <application root>\z88dk\lib\config\. The trailing 'slash' (or backslash) character matters.

	Z80_OZFILES
	It is the root path for the library files. It should be set to point to <application root>\z88dk\lib\. 

3. From the C:\z88dk\libsrc\_DEVELOPMENT\EXAMPLES\zx\demo_nirvanap folder (SDCC + New C Library seems to make a smaller tap file, guessing it's most efficient? Need to check if faster/slower when running though):

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * NIRVANA+ ENGINE DEMO - converted to z88dk C Compiler
 *
 * This program can be compiled as follows:
 *
 * 1. SCCZ80 + New C Library
 *
 *    zcc +zx -vn -startup=1 -clib=new nirvanadem.c btile.asm -o nirvanadem
 *    appmake +zx -b nirvanadem_CODE.bin -o nirvanadem.tap --noloader --org 32768 --blockname nirvanadem
 *    copy /B loader.tap+nirvanadem.tap demo.tap
 *
 * 2. SDCC + New C Library
 *
 *    zcc +zx -vn -SO3 -startup=1 -clib=sdcc_iy --max-allocs-per-node200000 nirvanadem.c btile.asm -o nirvanadem
 *    appmake +zx -b nirvanadem_CODE.bin -o nirvanadem.tap --noloader --org 32768 --blockname nirvanadem
 *    copy /B loader.tap+nirvanadem.tap demo.tap
 *
 * After compiling, a binary "nirvanadem_CODE.bin" containing the program is produced.
 * appmake is run to turn that portion into a CODE-only tap file.
 * Windows "copy" is used to concatenate that tap to the end of "loader.tap" to form the final tap file "demo.tap"
 *
 * "loader.tap" contains this basic loader:
 *
 * 10 CLEAR VAL "32767"
 * 20 LOAD "NIRVANA+"CODE
 * 30 LOAD ""CODE
 * 40 RANDOMIZE USR VAL "32768"
 *
 * followed by the NIRVANA+ engine code.  This engine code is supplied separately from z88dk (and is contained in this tap file).
 *
 * Thanks to Timmy for the first conversion to C of this demo.
